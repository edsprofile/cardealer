* README
This is a project to familiarize myself with the spring framework working with
the Cassandra databases. I do already know a little java, but this is also about
relearning java.
** The Project
I am following tutorials and reading documentation to help me learn some
material about the topics listed above. I am going to try to follow tutorials
but also keep the idea as original as I possibly can to make sure I am
understanding.
